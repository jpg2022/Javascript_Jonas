Objects in javascript remind of hashmaps that can use the this.
functionalty on its key value pairs

y &&= x //asigns y to x if y already exist (truthy)

 x ??= y //asign x to y if x is not null (0 is okay)

 x ||= y //assings if y is not falsy



 Object.entries(x) is the same format as new Map data structure

 for(const [key, val] of Map){
    
 }


Sets are like arrays, but only store UNIQUE VALUES, used to remove duplicate
values from arrays



array.entries() //gives mutiple arrays with index i of object from original
array as first element and second element as the actual obj


if you munitpulate an object in an function that object will change!!
NOT just a copy!!

book.call(objname, param1,param2)//the this keyword points to objname

.bind(objname, param1,param2) returns new function with the this 
keyword and param1 permanantly binded  


reduce method for arrays is getting array down to single value


inputCloseUsername
inputClosePin

some method finds things in arrays based on conditions

queryselector finds children of element

.closest finds parents of element

IntersectionObserver is hella weird




Promises for AJAX calls are like lottery tickets, you make the bet
and then some time in the future you find out if you won or not
